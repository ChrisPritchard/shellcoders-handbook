# Shellcoder's Handbook work

The stuff I put together (examples, experimentation) while working through the [Shellcoder's Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Shellcoders-Handbook-Discovering-Exploiting-Security/dp/047008023X/ref=sr_1_1) (Note: while the link is for amazon, I actually got the book via the Cybersecurity 2020 bundle on Humble Bundle for $1.50 :D )

My dev machine for this stuff was primarily WSL2 on Windows 10 running an Ubuntu dist, for those interested. And as an editor I used VS Code - interestingly, I used VS Code from windows, with a terminal window using bash in the same folder to compile projects, use GDB etc. What a world we live in xD
