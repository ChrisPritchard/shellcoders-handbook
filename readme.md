# Shellcoder's Handbook work

The stuff I put together (examples, experimentation) while working through the [Shellcoder's Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Shellcoders-Handbook-Discovering-Exploiting-Security/dp/047008023X/ref=sr_1_1) (Note: while the link is for amazon, I actually got the book via the Cybersecurity 2020 bundle on Humble Bundle for $1.50 :D )

I did these challenges on a windows 10 machine, and while I initially tried doing them under WSL this wouldn't work as WSL on windows is 64 bit only. Ultimately, the solution was to use a 32bit ubuntu virtual machine (I used the 16.04 LTS Server image) on virtualbox. Note virtualbox instead of Hyper-V: for this sort of stuff I find the former works better.
