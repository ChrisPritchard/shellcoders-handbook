# Shellcoder's Handbook work

The stuff I put together (examples, experimentation) while working through the [Shellcoder's Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Shellcoders-Handbook-Discovering-Exploiting-Security/dp/047008023X/ref=sr_1_1) (Note: while the link is for amazon, I actually got the book via the Cybersecurity 2020 bundle on Humble Bundle for $1.50 :D )

I also conducted experiments with the original [Smashing the Stack article by Aleph One in Phrack magazine](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html#article) ([PDF version](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs161/fa08/papers/stack_smashing.pdf)). A copy of this is in the root of this repo, in txt form.

Both the book and the article by Aleph One cover 32 bit machines. This is harder to do now, in 2020, especially since I did these challenges on machines running Windows 10. While I initially tried doing them under WSL this didn't work as WSL on Windows is 64 bit only. Ultimately, the solution was to use a 32bit Ubuntu virtual machine (I used the 16.04 LTS Server image) on Virtualbox. Note Virtualbox instead of Hyper-V: Linux seems to run better on Virtual Box, and also I believe Hyper-V likewise doesn't support 32 bit machines.

Also in this repo are a few markdown documents that I wrote largely to myself and which people might find helpful.
